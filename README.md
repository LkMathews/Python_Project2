How does the sequence and structure of tyrosinase, which cause colour point colouration in cats, differ from the tyrosinase that causes a similar phenotype in rabbits, and that which is responsible for the first step of melanin in humans?

There is a compressed folder called Data Files that contains all data files used in this code. Within that folder is another folder. 

Included files:
Cat.pdb (cat tyrosinase 3D protein structure)
Cat.fasta (amino acid sequence file)
Cat_Human.png (picture of model accuracy from SWISS Model)
Human.pdb (human tyrosinase 3D protein structure)
Human.fasta (amino acid sequence file)
Cat_Human_Model.pdb (Model from SWISS model)
Rabbit.fasta (amino acid sequence file)
Rabbit_Cat.png (picture of model accuracy from SWISS Model)
Rabbit_Cat_Model.pdb (Model from SWISS model)
Rabbit_Human.png (picture of model accuracy from SWISS Model)
Rabbit_Human_Model.pdb (Model from SWISS model)
